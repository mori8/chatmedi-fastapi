The assistant should focus more on the description of the model and find the model that has the most potential to solve requests. Also, prefer models with local inference endpoints for speed and stability.\n<im_start>user\n{user_input}\n<im_end>\n<im_start>assistant\nTask: {task}\nContext: {context}\n<im_end>\n<im_start>user\nPlease choose the most suitable model from {models} for the task {task}. The selection should prioritize the user input as the highest importance, ensuring the chosen model can best fulfill the user input. Additionally, consider the context provided, which includes any additional information necessary to complete the task. If the context contains information irrelevant to the task, you may ignore it. Use these details to determine which model is best suited for the task. The output must be in a strict JSON format:\n{{\n\"id\": \"model id\",\n\"reason\": \"your detailed reasons for the choice\",\n\"task\": \"task name\",\n\"input_args\": \"specific input arguments required by the selected model, based on its metadata information. This may include parameters like \"instruction\" and \"input\", and must be tailored to the selected model's needs.\"\n}}\nIMPORTANT: For the input_args field, refer to the selected model's metadata information \"inputs\" and format it accordingly. Each model may have different requirements for input_args. If the \"input_args\" cannot be generated with the given information, return input_args in the following format: {{\"error\": \"More information is needed\", \"message\": Please provide information about what more information is needed to run this model. For example, if you need image data to run the model, and you don't have any, you can include a request for more images. }}.\nNEVER attach any other sentences, just JSON.\n<im_end>\n<im_start>assistant"

  "template": "Given the user request, the AI assistant helps the user to generate the appropriate input arguments for the selected model based on the user's prompt. The assistant should focus on the model's metadata to ensure the input arguments are tailored to the selected model's needs. User input: {user_input} Selected model: {model_info} To perform the above task, here is some additional context. Context: {context} If you determine that this context is not related to the user input, do not use this information. Now, you need to create the model's input arguments. The format and description of each property of the input arguments you need to create are as follows: {{\"input_args\":{input_args}}} IMPORTANT: Make sure to carefully read and follow the descriptions for each property, and fill in the information accordingly. If it cannot be generated with the given information, fill the value of the argument that cannot be generated with \"more information needed\", and add an \"error\" property to the input_args. The value of the \"error\" property should explain why you couldn't generate {{ the names of the arguments that could not be generated }} and what additional information is needed to generate those values. The format you return must exactly match the input arguments format I provided above. NEVER attach any other sentences. The output you return must strictly adhere to JSON syntax."

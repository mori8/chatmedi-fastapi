The assistant should focus on the model's metadata to ensure the input arguments are tailored to the selected model's needs.\nUser input: {user_input}\nSelected model: {model_info}\nTo perform the above task, here is some additional context.\nContext: {context}\nIf you determine that this context is not related to the user input, do not use this information.\nNow, you need to create the model's input arguments. The format and description of each property of the input arguments you need to create are as follows:\n{input_args}\nIMPORTANT: Make sure to carefully read and follow the descriptions for each property, and fill in the information accordingly. The format you return must exactly match the input arguments format I provided above. NEVER attach any other sentences."

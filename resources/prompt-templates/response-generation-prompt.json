Do you have any demands regarding my response?\n<im_end>\n<im_start>user\nYes. Please first think carefully and directly answer my request based on the inference results. Some of the inferences may not always turn out to be correct and require you to make careful consideration in making decisions. Please provide a direct response with a brief mention of the selected model. Focus on delivering the final results in a friendly tone. Please explain the inference results in detail so the user can understand them well, but if the inference result is a simple output, for example, just an image, you don't need to explain it in detail. If there is nothing in the results, please tell me you can't make it.\n<im_end>\n<im_start>assistant"
